# 🐟 Automated Fish Pond (IoT-Based)

An intelligent IoT-based water quality monitoring and automation system designed for smart fish pond management.  
This system continuously monitors environmental parameters and automatically adjusts conditions to maintain optimal aquatic health and improve fish productivity.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Automated Fish Pond System** is developed to reduce manual effort in aquaculture management by integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and automated control mechanisms.

It collects real-time data from multiple water quality sensors and makes intelligent decisions to maintain a stable aquatic environment. The system ensures proper temperature, pH balance, turbidity levels, gas concentration, and feeding schedules.

- Controls aeration if harmful gas concentration increases
- Dispenses fish food automatically using servo motor

### 🧠 Intelligent Decision-Making
- Threshold-based control logic
- Efficient environmental stabilization
- Reduces stress and mortality rate of fish

### 📈 Scalability
- Expandable to larger ponds
- Suitable for commercial aquaculture
- Can be integrated with IoT dashboards for remote monitoring

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Maintain optimal aquatic conditions
- Reduce manual monitoring effort
- Improve fish growth and survival rate
- Increase efficiency in fish farming
- Enable smart and sustainable aquaculture

## 🔄 Working Principle

- If **temperature** deviates from optimal range → System alerts or activates corrective mechanism.
- If **pH level** is abnormal → Water exchange or balancing process starts.
- If **turbidity** increases → Water pump activates for cleaning.
- If **gas concentration** rises → Aeration system activates.
- At scheduled intervals → Servo motor dispenses fish feed automatically.
